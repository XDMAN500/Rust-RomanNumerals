# Rust-RomanNumerals
Rust-RomanNumerals is a program that has the ability to convert Roman Numerals to a Decimal value and convert a Decimal value to a Roman Numeral.


## Purpose
This implementation in rust is made as a programming exersise for me as I learn rust. Converting between the numeric types with this implementation requires knowlege of most of the primitive types, functions,  control flow loops, pattern matching, error handling, life times, mutable and immutable references, modules, the cargo build system, and macros.
